Bus Ticket Booking App Design Report
1. Introduction
This report provides an overview of the Figma design project for a bus ticket booking application. The app aims to simplify the process of booking bus tickets, choosing seats, and making payments. The design includes both low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes, showcasing the user interface's progression from basic structure to detailed visual presentation.
2. Design Process
2.1 Low-Fidelity Wireframe
The low-fidelity wireframe focuses on the structural layout of the app, giving a simple grayscale representation of each screen. This initial wireframe allows designers and stakeholders to visualize the primary features and navigation flow without the distraction of detailed visuals. Key screens in the low-fidelity design include:
- Splash Screen: A basic screen with a logo and a 'Get Started' button.
- Authentication Screen: Allows users to input credentials and log in or sign up.
- Home Screen: Displays a search bar for entering boarding and destination points.	Map Search Screen: Provides a map view to locate bus stops and plan routes.
- Find Bus and Select Seat Screens: Lists available buses and seating arrangements.
- Tickets, Wallet, and Settings Screens: Displays ticket history, wallet balance, and user settings.
 
2.2 High-Fidelity Wireframe
The high-fidelity wireframe builds upon the low-fidelity version by adding color, images, and detailed UI elements. This polished design represents the final visual style and prepares the app for development. Key screens include:
- Splash Screen: Now includes an illustration with vibrant colors to attract users.Authentication Screen: Enhanced with images and a refined input form for a better user experience.
- Home Screen: Contains a prominent 'Find Buses' button and displays scheduled journeys, giving users quick access to essential information.
- Map Search Screen: Uses a map with icons, offering an interactive way to search for bus routes.
- Find Bus and Select Seat Screens: Lists ticket prices, seat availability, and seat selection options. The high-fidelity design uses color-coded seats to differentiate between available and occupied ones.
- Guest Details Screen: Collects passenger information and contact details.
- Tickets, Wallet, and Settings Screens: Presents ticket information, payment options, and user settings with a clean and user-friendly layout.
